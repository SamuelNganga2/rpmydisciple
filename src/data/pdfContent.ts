### Introduction
I have this hope
As an anchor for my soul
Through every storm
I will hold to You
With endless love
All my fear is swept away
In everything
I will trust in You
There is hope in the promise of the cross
You gave everything
To save the world You love
And this hope is an anchor for my soul
Our God will stand
Unshakeable
I have this hope
As an anchor for my soul
Through every storm
I will hold to You
With endless love
All my fear is swept away
In everything
I will trust in You
There is hope in the promise of the cross
You gave everything
To save the world You love
And this hope is an anchor for my soul
Our God will stand
Unshakeable`
